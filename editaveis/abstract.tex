Motivation drives people to achieve goals and solve problems. This project aims to create a tool that uses gamification elements to shape user engagement. The use of gamification to motivate peopleâ€™s life has been discussed in the last years. Integrating technology and gamification aims to expand its use. Besides using game elements to engage people, gamification motivates with personal, professional and context causes. The construction of the tool began with literature review. From the review, a gamification model was chosen to support the core of the tool. Moreover, it supports choices made about the model construction. The initial proposal aims to deliver to users a gamification tool to support gamification project creation. It intends to be accessible to  whoever it may interest.
